# Testing Roga

This document provides guidance on testing the Roga logging system based on the comprehensive test plan.

## Test Plan Overview

The comprehensive test plan for Roga covers:

1. **Core Components**:
   - Roga: Main struct and initialization
   - Producer: Log and operation creation
   - Writer: Output to different destinations
   - Monitor: System metrics collection
   - Dispatcher: Routing logs and operations

2. **Test Types**:
   - Unit Tests: Testing individual components in isolation
   - Integration Tests: Testing interactions between components
   - End-to-End Tests: Testing the complete logging flow
   - Performance Tests: Testing system performance under load

3. **Key Areas to Test**:
   - Initialization and configuration
   - Log production at different levels
   - Operation management
   - System monitoring
   - File writing
   - Concurrency and thread safety
   - Error handling and edge cases

For the complete test plan, see `test_plan.md`.

## Sample Test Implementation

The `roga_test.go` file provides sample tests that demonstrate how to test key functionality of the Roga package:

1. **TestRogaInitialization**: Tests basic initialization and startup
2. **TestBasicLogging**: Tests logging at different levels
3. **TestOperationManagement**: Tests creating, nesting, and ending operations
4. **TestMonitoring**: Tests system monitoring functionality
5. **TestFileWriting**: Tests writing logs and operations to files

These tests serve as examples of how to implement the test plan and can be extended to cover more functionality and edge cases.

## How to Run Tests

To run the tests, use the standard Go testing command:

```bash
go test ./...
```

To run a specific test:

```bash
go test -run TestRogaInitialization
```

To run tests with verbose output:

```bash
go test -v ./...
```

## Extending the Tests

When extending the tests, consider the following:

1. **Test Coverage**: Aim to cover all components and functionality described in the test plan.

2. **Mocking**: For unit tests, consider mocking dependencies to isolate the component being tested.

3. **Edge Cases**: Include tests for edge cases and error scenarios, such as:
   - Empty log messages
   - Very large log messages
   - Unicode and special characters in logs
   - Extremely nested operations
   - File system errors
   - Out of memory conditions

4. **Performance Testing**: Add tests that measure throughput, resource usage, and latency.

5. **Concurrency Testing**: Add tests that verify thread safety and behavior under concurrent access.

## Best Practices

1. **Test Independence**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from other tests.

2. **Clean Up**: Always clean up resources after tests, especially when creating files or starting goroutines.

3. **Assertions**: Make clear assertions about expected behavior, not just that code doesn't panic.

4. **Test Organization**: Organize tests by component and functionality for better maintainability.

5. **Continuous Testing**: Run tests as part of CI/CD to catch regressions early.

## Conclusion

Testing is essential to ensure that Roga functions correctly, handles errors gracefully, and performs well under various conditions. By following this test plan and extending the sample tests, you can build a comprehensive test suite that provides confidence in the reliability of the Roga logging system.
