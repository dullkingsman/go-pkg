# Comprehensive Test Plan for Roga

## 1. Overview

This test plan outlines a comprehensive approach to testing the Roga logging system. Roga is a sophisticated logging package with multiple components working together to provide logging, monitoring, and metrics collection capabilities.

## 2. Components to Test

### 2.1 Core Components
- **Roga**: Main struct and initialization
- **Producer**: Log and operation creation
- **Writer**: Output to different destinations
- **Monitor**: System metrics collection
- **Dispatcher**: Routing logs and operations

### 2.2 Data Structures
- **Log**: Log entries with different levels and types
- **Operation**: Operations with timing and measurements
- **Context**: Application and system context

## 3. Test Types

### 3.1 Unit Tests
Test individual components in isolation with mocked dependencies.

### 3.2 Integration Tests
Test interactions between components.

### 3.3 End-to-End Tests
Test the complete logging flow from creation to output.
